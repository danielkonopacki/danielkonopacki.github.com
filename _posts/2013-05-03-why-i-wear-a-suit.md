This is the mantra of a generation loathed to putting on a suit, tie, or any combinatory dress. It used to be my mantra. In fact an entire industry – my industry – is iconic for hoodies and black turtlenecks.  I feel, however, that there is something lost in the statement, and most certainly in the attitude. We have relinquished grace and elegance for utilitarianism and I feel it just does not have to be that way. Allow me to elaborate.

To start, some background. My wife is German, as in _from_ Germany as opposed to Germanic descent. If you know much about European countries you will quickly realize that there still remains a sense of formality that is elusive to us Americans. Consider getting coffee. In Seattle standard practice is to receive your java in a paper cup. For porcelain one needs to explicitly request it. In Germany the experience is reversed, and in many cases one simply cannot order coffee to go. For them it is as much about the experience of drinking the coffee as it is the coffee itself.

A few years back while on holiday visiting my wife's parents we were shopping in the city center. Walking into a shop well known there for their fine china my wife exclaimed with much excitement on how she would so love one of the dainty tea sets one day. My internal reaction was much along the lines of this article's opening sentence – But isn't that for old ladies? What I responded with, however, was, "Sure, we can look into getting something like that."

As surprise for her later that year I fulfilled my wife's nostalgic wish and purchased a tea set for her. It was pricey, but I had recognized how happy it would make her. Along with the set I also purchased a set of crystal glassware. This would prove my epiphanic moment.

Earlier in my life I had studied at an art college. One of my project critics required a presentation of the piece we had worked on. After presenting mine, the professor lauded my oration, adding, “Presentation is 70% of what you do.” This was a statement I would carry with me and yet never fully integrate it into what I did. Consider the weight of that statement for a moment – branding and presentation is of such value to top-tier companies that they pay agencies and brand managers millions annually to maintain their image. That might be one offering low-cost products, lifestyle accessories, or thrilling entertainment. To be fair, it is not easy getting it right, and there lies plenty of evidence for what happens when its wrong.
