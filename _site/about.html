        <blockquote>I'm not a technologist; I'm a storyteller. I just happen to understand the alchemy behind the magic.</blockquote>
 
<p>Unconventional. That is who I am. My career as a software engineer began as an illustrator and graphic artist, while my origins with Disney sprouted as a Sales Associate for the Disney Store. Not once in my studies did I ever take a computer science course; initially self-taught, my fantastic colleagues have carried me further than I could ever have dreamed. This obscure route of my career, I believe, is what has helped me be successful in the diverse roles I have held. From being the lead of the highly innovative video platform previously used by the likes of ESPN and Disney.com, to envisioning the browser application architecture for Disney's next generation CMS.</p> 

<p>Today I get to build relationships across the entirety of Walt Disney, helping our businesses leverage emerging technologies arising from both inside and outside the company. It is a role that requires technical understanding, vision and, above all, collaborative skills. And it is these talents that I strive to perfect everyday.</p>

<p>Coding the magic of Disney is beyond being a simple job; it is the continuation of excellence in storytelling, brought to the digital age, by a heritage rich brand recognized the world over.</p>
