------------------------------

<p>Unconventional. That is who I am. My career as a software engineer began as an illustrator and graphic artist, while my origins with Disney sprouted as a Sales Associate for the Disney Store. Not once in my studies did I ever take a computer science course; initially self-taught, my fantastic colleagues have carried me further than I could ever have dreamed. This obscure route of my career, I believe, is what has helped me be successful in the diverse roles I have held. From being the lead of the highly innovative video platform previously used by the likes of ESPN and Disney.com, to envisioning the browser application architecture for Disneyâ€™s next generation CMS.</p> 

<p>Today I get to build relationships across the entirety of Walt Disney, helping our businesses leverage emerging technologies arising from both inside and outside the company. It is a role that requires technical understanding, vision and, above all, collaborative skills. And it is these talents that I strive to perfect everyday.</p>

<p>Coding the magic of Disney is beyond being a simple job; it is the continuation of excellence in storytelling, brought to the digital age, by a heritage rich brand recognized the world over.</p>
